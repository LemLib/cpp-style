# cpp-style

LemLib has its own C++ style. It's been designed from the ground up to prioritize readability by non-devs and reflect practices that are considered standard in the community (more or less)

The purpose of this repo is to provide a stadardized file for all of our projects. This is so styles between projects do not fall out of sync. It also makes it easier for people to create discussions specific to the style.
